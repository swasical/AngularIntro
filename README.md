AngularIntro
============

This demo demonstrates some key concepts of angularJs. Adapted from the excellent presentation by Dan Wahlin at ng-conf (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M).

To get started:
1. Download the example code.
2. Change the name of the directory in step_0\server.js to the location on your computer.
3. Open up a command prompt and cd to the folder step_0.
4. Run node server.
5. Go to localhost:3000 in a browser.

You are now ready to begin adding features.
